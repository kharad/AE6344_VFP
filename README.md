# AE6344_VFP
Repository for VFP - AVL model

Python based code that runs AVL model and obtains cp data
Currently, there are two main files:
  1. Run_AVL.py
  2. Run_AVL_old.py
First python code uses class module to store data and run AVL, while the second one is simple python script

The python scripts can iterate through following parameters in AVL:
  Flight Conditions:
    1. Velocity
    2. Angle of Attack
    3. Mach number
  Geometry Setup:
    1. Number of chordwise panels for wing
    2. Number of spanwise panels for wing
    3. Number of chordwise panels for horizontal tail
    4. Number of spanwise panels for horizontal tail
